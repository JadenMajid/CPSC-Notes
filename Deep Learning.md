Deep learning models are like [[Neural Networks]] with multiple hidden layers

$$o_i=h(z_{i1}^{(2)})$$
$$z_{i1}^{(2)}=h(x_{i1})$$
## Cost of layers
### Prediction
$$O(k^1d+k^1k^2...)$$
- need fewer parameters than "shallow but wide" [[Neural Networks]]
- Empirical Motivation for using multiple layers
	- Deep networks have lead to unprecedented performance
