## Description
Sets are a [[Collection]] of distinct objects with no repetitions. Sets are generally unordered, but can be ordered. Ordered sets are similar to [[Lists]], but do not allow repetition.


## Properties
- Sets do not allow repetition of objects
- Any object can be in a set, including other sets, or itself
- [[Convex|Convexity]]
	- Convexity is a set property where all values contained within a set may be joined by intermediate members that are also contained within that set
	- A [[Convex]] set

	- A [[Non-Convex]] set

- [[Concave|Concavity]]
	- Concavity for sets is not well defined
## Operations
-  $\cup$ : Union
	- Union is the joining of two sets into one new set. 
	- Sets cannot have duplicate items, so $||A \cup B|| \le ||A|| + ||B||$
	- $A = \{1,2\}, B=\{2,3,4\}, A\cup B=\{1,2,3,4\}$
- $\cap$ : Intersection
	- The Intersection of two sets is the common subset of both sets
	- The Intersection of two [[Congruency|Congruent]] sets is the input set
	- The Intersection of two [[Disjoint]] sets is the $\varnothing$ : Null Set
	- $A = \{1,2\}, B=\{2,3,4\}, A\cap B=\{2\}$
- - : Difference
	- The difference between two sets A, B is the elements in A that are not present in B
	- $A = \{1,2\}, B=\{2,3,4\}, A\cap B=\{1\}$
- $A^c\text{ or }\bar{A}$  : Complement
	- The complement of a set $A$ is $U - A$

## Set Relationships
- $A\supseteq B$ : Superset
	- $A$ is a set that contains as least every element of $B$
	- $A\cup B = A$
- $A\supset B$ : Proper Superset
	- 

## Special Sets
- $\varnothing$ : The null set
	- The same as an empty set
	- All empty/null sets are 
- U : The universal set
	- A set containing all values in a given context
