Convexity is when any two points within a given area can be joined, without leaving the area. The "opposite" of convexity is [[Concave|Concavity]], however the two are not [[Disjoint]]. For example f(x)=0 is both convex and [[Concave]].

For functions, convexity occurs when any points above f(x) can be joined without leaving the area above the function.
