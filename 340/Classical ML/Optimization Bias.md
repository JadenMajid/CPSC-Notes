Optimization Bias, or overtraining is the phenomena where a model begin to train to the [[Variance]] within [[Training]] Data
. Optimization bias leads to lower model error in the [[Training]] Dataset, but higher error in the [[Validation]] Dataset. 

Optimization Bias is an effect of the [[Fundamental Tradeoff]], where models that are too simple are training on the [[Bias]] within a dataset, but models that are too complicated are training on the [[Variance]] of the [[Training]] Data.
