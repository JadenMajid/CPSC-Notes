Decision Trees are a type of [[Supervised Learning]] where simple rules for datasets are learned.
Nested rules are applied to predict the category of datapoints.

Decision Trees are the most basic type of machine learning. The most basic type of [[Decision Trees]] will try to split the data at a given [[Decision Stump]] to most accurately predict the data at the [[Decision Stump]].

The performance of Decision trees can be improved by using [[Information Entropy]] and [[Infogain]].
