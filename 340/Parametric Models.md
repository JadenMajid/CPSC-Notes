Parametric models are models in which a fixed amount of parameters are [[Training|Trained]] to a given [[Training]] dataset, and learn rules for a given model. 

The opposite of a [[Parametric Models|Parametric Model]] is a [[Non-Parametric Models| Non Parametric Model]].

A general rule of thumb for [[Parametric Models]], is `Given an infinite dataset, a parametric model will have a fixed size`\
