[[GUI]] design patterns are patterns that apply to the graphical interfaces of applications
The design patterns still apply, we want to minimize [[Coupling]] and maximize [[Cohesion]]

GUIs can be thin, or thick. Neither is good nor bad, just different and for different tasks. GUIs can be too thick or too thin, but it is highly task dependent

- Thin GUIs
	- are when guis are minimal, and basic, accomplishing the core functionality
- Thick GUIs
	- are when guis are complicated, and have a lot of functionality

- Patterns
	- [[Model View Controller (MVC)]]
	- [[Model-View-Presenter(MVP)]]
	- [[Model-View-ViewModel(MVVM)]]
	- [[Component Based]]
