MVP is a GUI Design pattern similar to [[Model View Controller (MVC)]], with de[[Coupling]] of View and Model.

The model and view should be black boxes with no interactions from the perspective of each other

The key difference with [[Model View Controller (MVC)]] is that Model and View do not interact with each other at all.
