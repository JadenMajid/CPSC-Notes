Divergent changes are when changes to a method lead to needed changes to unrelated methods in the same class. 

Divergent changes happen when one class has too many responsibilities, and should be split up into different classes

Divergent changes are the opposite code smell to [[Shotgun Surgery]], but appears similar.
The difference is that Divergent changes happen within the same class, but shotgun surgery is when changes are for many different classes.
