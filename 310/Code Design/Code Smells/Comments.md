Comments are not necessarily a bad thing, but an overabundance of comments in code can indicate that the code being written is unclear or hard to read.

Comments are also a form of technical debt, that can lead to [[Documentation Drift]]. In well named and well documented code, the names of methods should be clear enough(in most cases) to show what it is doing.

```
comments often are used as a deodorant.  
It’s surprising how often you look at thickly  
commented code and notice that the comments  
are there because the code is bad.
