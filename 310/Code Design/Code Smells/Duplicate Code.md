Duplicate code is honestly pretty self explanatory. When code is duplicated, changes to the duplicated code immediately become non local. This is bad because a reminder needs to be placed to change both instances, or leads to unexpected behaviour.

we can solve duplicate code with refactoring out the duplicated code to its own function or method.
