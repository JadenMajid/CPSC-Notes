INVEST is a set of principles that [[User Stories]] should follow.
- INVEST
	- Independent
		- User stories should have minimal [[Coupling]]
	- Negotiable
		- Stake holders should be able to have a share in how the final user stories look. If the end users can't give their input, then we may be making something they did not ask for or want
	- Valuable
		- User stories should always add value to the end user of the product. If they aren't valuable why would we spend time on it?
	- Estimable
		- User stories should be an amount of work that we can roughly predict. If we can't predict how long something will take, then cost overrun can become a large issue
	- Small
		- User stories should be for small features, that may sum into a larger feature. If a user story is too large, then it can't be assigned to one person
	- Testable
		- We need to be able to know when we are done, and if what we have done is correct
